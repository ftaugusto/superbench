		<h2 class="Benchmark">Welcome to Superbench!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Superbench</em></strong> is an app designed to easier searching IBM Power Systems benchmarking (rPerf and CPW). As SAPs benchmark is also available, you can use it to compare system performance from different vendors. The tool can be useful for sizings, consolidation projects, modernization and system&rsquo;s upgrades or updates. You can use it in adaptations if your project is moving to the cloud (IaaS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tool is intuitive and ease-to-use:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Select the benchmark from list;</li>
<li>Click show
<ul>
<li>A full table is shown (you can use browsers find option to find the system you want)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now filter the table. The tool uses all the fields for filtering. Tip: use the vertical bar (&ldquo;|&rdquo;) if you want a filter with more than one option (ex.: p8|p9)</li>
<li>An option to plot comparison graphs is also available. Just select the systems you want in the graph and click &ldquo;Plot Graphs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Clicking on the column headers will sort the table ascending/descending. Bear in mind to use sorting feature after applying some filter. Otherwise the sort will take some time to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that <strong><em>Superbench</em></strong> keeps its own benchmarks tables for better availability. Therefore, some brand-new published benchmarks may take some time to appear in the tool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although some other benchmarks exist, they are either restricted or not that market relevant. So, if your are looking for these benchmarks, please access the publisher&rsquo;s own site.</p>
